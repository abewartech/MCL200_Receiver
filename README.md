The MCL200 is a compact LED marine lantern, solar self-contained, with great optical efficiency
and low consumption, fitted with LED diodes of high intensity, reaching a maximum range of 9
nautical miles and offering a big autonomy.
As a difference from the MCL 200, this lantern is ready to integrate a remote monitoring and
synchronization system.
The battery is replaceable, thus the complete lantern disposal is not necessary at the end of
batteryâ€™s life. Standard fixings allow for a quick beacon replacement.
Remote supervision via GSM, VHF or satellite, synchronization module via GPS.
Designed according to IALA Recommendations.
